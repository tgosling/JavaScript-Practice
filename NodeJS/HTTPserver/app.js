/** The http.createServer() method returns an instance of an http.server. An http.server has a method .listen() which causes the server to “listen” for incoming connections. When we run http.createServer() we pass in a custom callback function (often referred to as the requestListener). This callback function will be triggered once the server is listening and receives a request.
    Let’s break down how the requestListener callback function works:

    -The function expects two arguments: a request object and a response object.
    -Each time a request to the server is made, Node will invoke the provided requestListener
     callback function, passing in the request and response objects of the incoming request.
    -Request and response objects come with a number of properties and methods of their own, 
     and within the requestListener function, we can access information about the request via the request object passed in.
    -The requestListener is responsible for setting the response header and body.
    -The requestListener must signal that the interaction is complete by calling the response.end() method.
